title: A few words about the new menu
---
### Type’s menu is updated

Now it’s wide, searchable, and super keyboard-friendly.

Hit `Ctrl / ⌘` `K` to open and close the menu. Search or use arrows keys `↑↓` to move around, `Enter` to run commands.

### Why?

As *type* grows, cramming everything into that old three-dot menu just wasn’t cutting it. 

New menu is bigger, scrollable, you no longer need to aim with your mouse, and you can filter out the options. 

If you’re a touch user, you’re covered with a closer-to-finger menu button and bigger touch zones.

### Has the menu content changed?

As the menu becomes the new hub, now you can be more specific with more available actions. E.g., not just “Change font”, but “Use serif font”.

This update isn’t just about looks. It’s a strong foundation for more features down the road. Hope you like it!
